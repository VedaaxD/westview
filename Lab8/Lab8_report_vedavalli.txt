Exercise 3
//Pseudocode for checking whether the given number is a Prime number.
{
initialize prime=TRUE
 (( for i=2 ; i<number ; i++ )) 
// check if the number is 1
	{if (( number == 1 ))
	then 
		echo " $number is a unique number "
	}
// check if the number is less than or equal to 0
	{if (( number -le 0 ))
	then
		echo " $number is an invalid entry."
	}
// for number>=2 check if the number is divisible by all the numbers from 3 to itself and if the remainder is 0
for (( i = 2; i<$number; i++ ))
	{if (( number % i == 0 ))
	then
		prime=FALSE
		break
